// An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.
// there are two types of expressions
// 1. those that assign value to a variable
// 2. those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value.

 var x=15; // 1st Expression
 15 + 13 // 2nd Expression

    //Primary expressions

        var z= x+(y/z) // Grouping operator
