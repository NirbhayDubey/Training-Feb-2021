(b) symmetric and transitive
(c) equivalence relation
(d) symmetric

2. Given triangles with sides T1 : 3, 4, 5; T2 : 5, 12, 13; T3 : 6, 8, 10; T4 : 4, 7, 9 and a relation R in set of triangles defined as R = {(Δ1, Δ2) : Δ1 is similar to Δ2}. Which triangles belong to the same equivalence class?
(a) T1 and T2
(b) T2 and T3
(c) T1 and T3

(b) symmetric if (2, 3) is added
(c) transitive if (1, 1) is added
(d) symmetric if (3, 2) is added
