Trigger Limitations :

=> Triggers can be nested to up to 32 levels. 
    A trigger is considered to be nested when it performs an action that fires another trigger.

=> Batch's first statement should be 'CREATE TRIGGER'

=> The same trigger action can be defined for more than one user action in the same CREATE TRIGGER statement.
    for example, INSERT and UPDATE 

=> Any SET statement can be specified inside a trigger. 

=> If we have defined any set option, then it would remain in effect during the execution of the trigger.
    And then reverts to its former setting.

=> The following Transact-SQL statements aren't allowed in a DML trigger:
    - ALTER DATABASE
    - CREATE DATABASE
    - DROP DATABASE
    - RESTORE DATABASE
    - RESTORE LOG
    - RECONFIGURE

=> The following Transact-SQL statements aren't allowed inside the body of a DML trigger 
    when it's used against the table or view that's the target of the triggering action.

    - CREATE INDEX 
    - ALTER INDEX
    - DROP INDEX
    - DROP TABLE
    - ALTER PARTITION FUNCTION

=> ALTER TABLE when used to do the following:
    - Add, modify, or drop columns.
    - Switch partitions.
    - Add or drop PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraints.
